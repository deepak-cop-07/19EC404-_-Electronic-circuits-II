### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |610Hz|360Hz  |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |470KHz |270KHz  |
| 3 | Bandwidth |489.39KHz  |269.64KHz  |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain |12.88  |8.40  |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 9.10 | 5.63 |


---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
